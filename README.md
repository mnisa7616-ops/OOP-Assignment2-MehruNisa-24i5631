Question 1: Recursion
This question demonstrates the use of recursion in C++.
•	Part (a) implements a recursive function to reverse characters between two given indices in a character array.
•	Part (b) prints a specific numeric pattern recursively.
•	Key Concepts Used: Function calls, recursion base case, array manipulation, and pattern generation.

Question 2: Singly Linked List (NASA Geospatial Features)
In this question, a singly linked list is used to store NASA’s geospatial features. The list can handle both LandFeature and WaterFeature objects using inheritance and polymorphism.
Key Features Implemented:
• Base class Feature with virtual analyze() function
• Derived classes LandFeature and WaterFeature
• SinglyLinkedList with insert, delete, display, and reverse functions
• Demonstration of object-oriented principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

Question 3: Doubly Linked List (Library System)
•	This question involves implementing a doubly linked list to manage a collection of books. Each node contains a book’s ID, title, and author. The list supports adding and deleting books and displaying them in both forward and reverse order.
•	Key Concepts: Node linking (next and prev), dynamic memory, and bidirectional traversal.

Question 4: Queue (Movie Ticket Booking System)
•	This question simulates a queue system for booking movie tickets. Each customer has an ID, name, and number of tickets. The queue supports enqueue, dequeue, and display operations.
•	Concepts Covered: FIFO structure, linked list-based queue implementation, constructors, and destructors for memory management.

Question 5: Stack Implementations and Algorithm Analysis
This question focuses on implementing stacks using two different data structures – linked list and array. Both versions support push, pop, and display operations. It also includes a runtime analysis of both implementations.
Runtime Analysis Summary:
• Push and Pop: O(1) for both implementations
• Memory: Linked List Stack (Dynamic), Array Stack (Fixed)
• Performance: Array stack is slightly faster due to contiguous memory allocation.
